# Lego Collection Website
<p>
  Welcome to the Lego Collection Website repository! This website is made to practice my skills which involved the WEB322 course. I used my Frontend and Backend skills to create this website which are ES6, Tailwind CSS (daisyUI) ExpressJS for Frontend and MongoDB and PostgreSQL for Backend(Server side) including JSON, AJAX, and EJS for more advanced skills. I hope this website will be something for someone who wants to improve their skills!
